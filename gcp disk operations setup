Thanks for the update! You're **almost there** — your **disk (`/dev/sda`) is now 16G**, but your **root partition (`/dev/sda1`) is still only 9.9G**, which is why you’re getting the **“no space left on device”** error.

Let’s **expand the root partition** (`sda1`) and **resize the filesystem** so it can use the full 16 GB disk.

---

## ✅ Final Steps to Fix the Disk Space Error

### 🔧 Step 1: Grow the Partition to Use Full Disk

Run this command to grow the root partition:

```bash
sudo growpart /dev/sda 1
```

If it succeeds, you'll see something like:

```
CHANGED: partition=1 start=2048 old: size=..., new: size=...
```

---

### 🛠 Step 2: Resize the Filesystem

Now resize the filesystem on `/dev/sda1`:

```bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1
```

> ✅ This will allow the partition to use all available space on disk.

---

### 📊 Step 3: Verify the Resize

```bash
df -h
```

You should now see something like:

```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        16G   5G   11G   33% /
```

---

### 📦 You can now try your Docker or installation command again

Your **"no space left on device"** error should be gone.

---

If you're still stuck, just copy-paste the output of these commands:

```bash
lsblk
df -h
```

And I’ll pinpoint what’s missing. Want me to script this entire resize process for reuse on other VMs?
